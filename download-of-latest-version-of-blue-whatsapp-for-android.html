Whatsapp For Android Apk</h2><p><strong>As featured in:</strong></p><p>To access WhatsApp Web service on a PC, you need to scan a QR code using the WhatsApp app installed on your smartphone. To scan this code, click on the download link in the green box at the top of this page. Then if you’re an Android user, go to Chats  Menu  WhatsApp Web. If you’re an iPhone user, go to Settings  WhatsApp Web.</p><p>WhatsApp Beta for Android lets you enjoy the latest additions to the messaging service before they hit the final release on Google Play Store. The latest Beta adds the long awaited Dark Theme feature. More instructions on how to enable it are in the description below.</p><p>WhatsApp is available for Android, iPhone / iOS and Windows / Mac. WhatsApp is a cross-platform messaging service, so those devices can all message each other. Because WhatsApp Messenger uses the same internet data plan that you use for email and web browsing, there is no cost to message and stay in touch with your friends.</p><p>In addition to basic messaging WhatsApp users can create groups, send each other unlimited images, video and audio media messages.</p><p><strong>Features:</strong></p><ul><li><strong>No hidden costs</strong>: Once you and your friends download the application, you can use it to chat as much as you want. Send a million messages a day to your friends for free! WhatsApp uses your Internet connection: Edge/3G/4G or Wi-Fi when available.</li><li><strong>Multimedia</strong>: Send Video, Images, and Voice notes to your friends and contacts.</li><li><strong>Group Chat</strong>: Enjoy group conversations with your contacts. Add or Remove group participants, change group subject and set a group icon.</li><li><strong>Personal</strong>: Set a profile photo which will be shown to all your contacts</li><li><strong>No international charges</strong>: Just like there is no added cost to send an international email, there is no cost to send WhatsApp messages internationally. Chat with your friends all over the world as long as they have WhatsApp Messenger installed and avoid those pesky international SMS costs.</li><li><strong>Say no to pins and usernames</strong>: Why even bother having to remember yet another PIN or username? WhatsApp works with your phone number, just like SMS would, and integrates flawlessly with your existing phone address book.</li><li><strong>No need to log in/out</strong>: No more confusion about getting logged off from another computer or device. With push notifications WhatsApp is always on and always connected.</li><li><strong>No need to add buddies</strong>: Your Address Book is used to automatically connect you with your contacts. Your contacts who already have WhatsApp Messenger will be automatically displayed under Favorites, similar to a buddy list.</li><li><strong>Offline Messages</strong>: Even if you miss your push notifications or turn off your iPhone, WhatsApp will save your messages offline until you retrieve them during the next application use.</li><li><strong>And much more</strong>: Share location and places, Exchange contacts, Custom wallpaper, Custom notification sounds, Landscape mode, Message timestamps, Email chat history, Broadcast messages and media to many contacts at once, and much much more.</li></ul><p><strong>What's New:</strong></p><p>WhatsApp is fast becoming a store counter to discuss products and coordinate sales. Catalogs have allowed people to quickly see what’s available and helped businesses organize their chats around particular items. With more and more shopping happening through chats, we want to make buying and selling even easier.</p><p>Starting today, we’re excited to bring carts to WhatsApp. Carts are great when messaging businesses that typically sell multiple items at once, like a local restaurant or clothing store. With carts, people can browse a catalog, select multiple products and send the order as one message to the business. This will make it simpler for businesses to keep track of order inquiries, manage requests from customers and close sales.</p><p>For example, Agradaya, a sustainable herbs and spices business in Yogyakarta, Indonesia got early access to the feature and told us how carts are a convenient way to understand what the customer is ordering without all the back and forth communication.</p><p>Using carts is easy. Simply find the items you want and tap “add to cart”. Once your cart is complete, send it as a message to the business. More details on using carts can be found here.</p><p>Carts are going live around the world today -- just in time for the holiday season. Happy shopping on WhatsApp!</p><p><strong>Advanced Search</strong></p><p>Now when you search in Whatsapp, you can now also choose to search Photos, Videos, Links, GIFs, Audio or Documents. <a href='/latin-urban-vst-download.html'>/latin-urban-vst-download.html</a>.</p><p><b>Dark Mode is finally here!</b> To install follow these instructions:</p><ol><li>Download the file found here.</li><li>Open Whatsapp, touch the three dot menu in the upper right corner and select Settings.</li><li>In Settings, select Chats (Theme, wallpapers, chat history)</li><li>In Chats, select Theme and within Theme you will find Dark.</li></ol><p><strong>Previous releases:</strong></p><ul><li>Added call waiting support so you can choose to accept an incoming WhatsApp call while you're already on another call.</li><li>You can now require a fingerprint to unlock WhatsApp. Tap Settings &gt; Account &gt; Privacy &gt; Fingerprint lock and enable Unlock with fingerprint.</li><li>Fixed an issue which caused fast battery drain.</li></ul><p><strong>New Privacy Settings for Groups</strong></p><p>WhatsApp groups continue to connect family, friends, coworkers, classmates and more. As people turn to groups for important conversations, users have asked for more control over their experience. Today, we're introducing a new privacy setting and invite system to help you decide who can add you to groups.</p><p>To enable it, go to Settings in your app, then tap Account &gt; Privacy &gt; Groups and select one of three options: 'Nobody', 'My Contacts', or 'Everyone'. 'Nobody' means you'll have to approve joining every group to which you're invited, and 'My Contacts' means only users you have in your address book can add you to groups.</p><p>In those cases, the person adding you to a group will be prompted to send a private invite through an individual chat, giving you the choice of joining the group. You'll have three days to accept the invite before it expires.</p><p>With these new features, users will have more control over the group messages they receive. These new privacy settings will begin rolling out to some users starting today and will be available worldwide in the coming weeks to those using the latest version of WhatsApp.</p><p><strong>Introducing Stickers</strong></p><p>From emoji and camera features to Status and animated GIFs, we’re always looking to add new features that make communicating with friends and family on WhatsApp easy and fun. We’re excited to introduce a new way for people to express themselves with stickers.</p><p>We've also added support for third-party sticker packs to allow designers and developers around the world to create stickers for WhatsApp. To do this, we've included a set of APIs and interfaces that allow you to build sticker apps that add stickers to WhatsApp on Android or iOS. You can publish your sticker app like any other app to the Google Play Store or Apple App Store, and users who download and install your app will be able to start sending those stickers right from within WhatsApp. You can learn more about creating your own sticker apps for WhatsApp here.</p><p>To use stickers in a chat, simply tap the new sticker button and select the sticker you want to share. You can add new sticker packs by tapping the plus icon.</p><h2>Download Of Latest Version Of Blue Whatsapp For Android Phones</h2><p><strong>Deleting messages. You can delete messages for everyone or just for yourself.</strong></p><p><em>To delete messages for everyone</em></p><p>Deleting messages for everyone allows you to delete specific messages you have sent to either a group or an individual chat. This is particularly useful if you sent a message to the wrong chat or if the message you sent contains a mistake.</p><p>Messages you successfully delete for everyone will be replaced with 'This message was deleted' in your recipients' chats (*). Similarly, if you see 'This message was deleted' in a chat, it means that the sender deleted their message for everyone.</p><p>You can only delete messages for everyone for up to seven minutes after sending. Once seven minutes have passed, there is no way to delete messages for everyone. To delete messages for everyone:</p><ul><li>Open WhatsApp and go to the chat containing the message you wish to delete.</li><li>Tap and hold the message &gt; choose Delete from the menu. Optionally, select more messages to delete multiple messages at once.</li><li>Tap Delete &gt; Delete for Everyone.</li></ul><p><em>To delete messages for yourself</em></p><p>Deleting messages for yourself allows you to delete your copy of messages you've sent or received from your phone. This has no effect on your recipients' chats. Your recipients will still see the messages in their chat screen. To delete messages for yourself:</p><ul><li>Open WhatsApp and go to the chat containing the message you wish to delete.</li><li>Tap and hold the message &gt; choose Delete from the menu. Optionally, select more messages to delete multiple messages at once.</li><li>Tap Delete &gt; Delete for Me.</li></ul><p><strong>Web client for desktop computers</strong></p><p>The desktop app is available for Windows 8 and Windows 10, and Mac OS 10.9 and higher, and is synced with WhatsApp on your mobile device. Because the app runs natively on your desktop, you'll have support for native desktop notifications, better keyboard shortcuts, and more. Upon downloading and opening the app, scan the QR code using the WhatsApp app on your phone (look for WhatsApp Web menu under Settings).</p><div><h3>Recent WhatsApp Beta for Android news</h3></div><ul><li><div> Privacy information has to be listed in the App Store only </div></li><li><div> Conversations will be deleted automatically after seven days </div></li></ul><ul><li><div><span>2063</span> votes </div><div><div> Download the latest version of WhatsApp Messenger for free.
