Is root explorer safe to use?</h3><p>Ans. It depends on you. The use of root explorer can cause some damage to the apps/game you have installed on your device if you deleted some important elements of the app or game that is required to run them.</p><p>Moreover, you may also delete system sounds or any other fundamental requirement of your android device and your device may fail to run correctly. So we advise you to <strong>NOT TO USE ANY FEATURE</strong> that you don’t know about. If you don’t know what will happen don’t try it. Just do a quick Google search on the name of the file you want to modify and you will know whether you should delete/modify or keep it untouched.</p><h3>Q. Will I get banned if the app or game developer finds that I am using Root Explorer?</h3><p>Ans. The app or game developer won’t know that you are using root explorer because it is designed in such a fashion. Moreover, there is no single evidence of our user getting banned by using root explorer.</p><h3>Q. Are all apps and games supported?</h3><p>Ans. <strong>Games:</strong> The offline games can be hacked by root explorer. We cannot use this app to hack online games because this can modify only the data stored in your device only but in the case of offline games, they are stored in the server of the game, so we cannot change them as we can’t have access to the server. So, to hack such games you need to hack a server which is not possible with any kind of tool available for android till today.</p><p><strong>Apps: </strong>Actually there is not much you can do to apps but anyway all apps are supported. You can easily modify them but be sure what you are doing.</p><h3>Q. My device says installation blocked.
