Get on my back and I'm going to carry you. I don't care if we fail, I'm going to wake up the next morning and I'm going to start working out and prepare for the next year,' Richard Jefferson said. '.. He was like, 'I'm going to come back home because I promised them that I would do something.' And he carried us the whole way.'</p><p>In a testy series of blowouts -- and a few blowups -- the winner-take-all Game 7 provided the thrilling finale with James as the Finals MVP disarming two-time reigning MVP Stephen Curry and his record-setting Warriors.</p><p>The native of Akron rattled off moments from the lengthy list of Cleveland sports heartbreak and said what it meant for him to personally bring the Cavaliers their first championship.</p><p>Playing his sixth straight Finals, James almost single-handedly carried the Cavs back into this series and finished with 27 points, 11 assists and 11 rebounds as the Cavs gave their city its first major sports winner since the Browns won the NFL title in 1964. He also had three blocked shots, including a key one of Andre Iguodala on a fast break in the final minutes.</p><p>An emotional James fell to the floor when this one ended with a second win in a week on Golden State's imposing home floor, surrounded by his teammates. Only moments earlier, he went down in pain with 10.6 seconds left after being fouled by Draymond Green while going for a dunk, then came back out to make the second of two free throws.</p><h3>2016 Nba Finals Full Game 6</h3><img src='https://2.bp.blogspot.com/-ItRFQ2hTgA8/V2h6W5LOF9I/AAAAAAAAKyQ/myDyHaSJ5RU5Roewao7D-ZXVE4R_fd1YgCLcB/w1200-h630-p-k-no-nu/39462270.jpg' alt='Finals' title='Finals'><p>After four successful seasons in Miami and two titles with the Heat, James came back to the Cavs in hopes of winning the title this franchise and championship-starved city so coveted. It took a second try against Golden State after Cleveland lost to the Warriors in six games last year.</p><p>'I was calm. I was focused. I was locked in,' James said.</p><p>Cleveland did it after a coaching change, with Tyronn Lue taking over in January for the fired David Blatt.</p><p>'We made history tonight,' Lue said. 'Cleveland, Ohio, we're coming back, baby!'</p><h3>2016 Nba Finals Full Game 1</h3><p>Kyrie Irving scored 26 points to cap his brilliant Finals, including a 3-pointer over Curry with 53 seconds left.</p><p>Curry sat briefly on the bench to take in the scene after the Warriors made their last basket with 4:39 left.</p><p>'It hurts, man,' Curry said.
