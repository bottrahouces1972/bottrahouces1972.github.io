This is probably the reason why it is so hard to find it on the web. To fill the gap, here are some simple G-code files so that the CNC newbie might have something to try out his or her machine with.</p><p><a href='/ulead-photoimpact-8-full-version.html'>/ulead-photoimpact-8-full-version.html</a>. These files were all tested to make sure they worked correctly, but I can’t guarantee that I didn’t leave something out accidentally. I don’t know the limits of your machine, so be careful and practice cutting air first.</p><h2 id='cnc-g-code-list-download-full'>Cnc G Code List Download Full</h2><p>Use a router bit with a fairly small diameter for these files. (1/8″ or smaller for example.) These G-code files are set up so that the router bit will just barely graze the surface of what’s being cut. If your machine isn’t quite level, the depth of the cut may need to be adjusted to compensate. This cannot be done with the G-code files (at least not easily), but it can be done with the CamBam files below.</p><p><em>Click the image to download the G-code file. </em></p><h3><span>CamBam Files</span></h3><p>CamBam files have the advantage that you can edit them before generating the G-code so that it will work better with your particular machine. Make sure you double check the settings I used because what might work perfectly fine on my CNC machine could cause problems on yours.</p><p>In case you didn’t know, CamBam is free if you only want to do 2.5D. It can be found here.</p><p><strong>Note:</strong> When you open some of these files in CamBam you may have to click and drag over the screen to make the image visible. I’m not sure why this is and would fix it if I knew how.</p><p><em>Click the image to download the CamBam file. </em></p><p><strong>Faces</strong></p><p>Use a router bit with a fairly small diameter for these faces. (1/8″ for example.)</p><p><strong>Gears</strong></p><p>Here is an assortment of gears. The tutorial for making them can be found on the page . They should be all set for turning into G-code, but double check the settings of the 2.5D profiles to make sure they won’t cause problems for your machine.</p><p>I personally haven’t had the chance to cut some of these gears out, so be careful and practice cutting air first.</p><p>I already put a hole in the center of each of the gears, but if you want to delete it and put one of a different size, you can do it with CAMBAM.</p><p>The gears below are meant to be cut with a 1/8″ router bit from MDF 3/4″ thick. The gear on the left has a pitch radius of 1.5″ the gear in the middle has a pitch radius of 3″, and the gear on the right has a pitch radius of 6″. Please note that the pitch radius is actually smaller than the total radius of the gear, so the gears might end up bigger than you expected them to be. These three gears should all mesh with one another if need be.</p><p><strong>Tutorial Gear</strong></p><p>This is the gear made in the tutorial .</p><div class='awgec'><iframe width='auto' height='auto' src='https://www.youtube.com/embed/fHTOJeBjMmo' frameborder='0' allowfullscreen=""></iframe></div><p><strong>Miscellaneous gear</strong></p><p>This is a spare gear file that I had laying around on my computer. It is set up to be cut out with a 1/4″ diameter router bit, but that can be changed in CamBam of course.
