You’ll find QuickLoad, QuickTarget, QuickTarget Unlimited in Start menu under “all apps”.</p><p>You may attach them manually to “Start” area. (right click on program icon and select “fix it to Start”) This is because Win10 does no longer allow Desktop icons programmatically installed. Therefore the installer has to be altered. QL v3.6 allows the user to select “Install desktop icons and entries in Start menu” Because of Win8 (no longer Start menu) it was altered to force desktop icons for QL 3.8. QL v.3.9 has now Start menu entries but no desktop icons (the user cannot select desktop icons, they were switched off when installer detects Win10. Furthermore the de-install Icon is not installed in Start menu.

Both books predicted the effectiveness of all types of ammunition by studying the results of real-life shootings rather than relying on laboratory tests that ignored the dynamics of an actual gunfight. This third book in the series provides the very latest street results of all the major handgun calibers, from .22 LR to .45 ACP, as well as popular rifle and shotgun loads. It also contains chapters on short-barrel ballistics, the emergence of the hot new .357 SIG caliber, the continued success of the .40 S&amp;W, the development of the latest exotic ammo, the effectiveness of black powder firearms and a brand-new ammo test protocol based on the results of the many gunfights of U.S. Border Patrol officers.</p><p>Handgun Stopping Power : The Definitive Study</p><p>Dramatic first-hand accounts of the results of handgun rounds fired into criminals by cops, storeowners, cabbies and others are the heart and soul of this long-awaited book.

As such, it is the safest full-power training ammo for police and military shooters, civilian range owners and casual shooters. Despite its widespread acceptance, however, there has been no in-depth study of this cutting-edge round . . . until now. This book remedies that by teaching the potential user what a frangible round is, what they can and cannot be used for, how to construct safe training devices and facilities and the proper street and service uses for the round.</p><p>Cartridges of the World (Cartridges of the World)</p><p>This benchmark volume is the foremost source for cartridge information.

In fact, there are more types of shells and shot sizes on the market now than ever before. With the overwhelming selection of shells available, here, finally, is a practical, reasonably priced book that makes sense of it all. It lists commercially available shotshell loads from the .410-bore to the 10-gauge, in all shot sizes available, different shot types (lead, steel, bismuth, tungsten, and others) so that the shooter or hunter can quickly find what will be best for the gun he has and the game or targets he wants to shoot. Each shotgun shell with each loading has its own table–over 1,600 tables!!–showing shot size; weight of shot; recoil; average number of pellets in the shell; manufacturer’s order number; shell length and type of hull; type of wad; and whether the shot is buffered or not. In addition, each table contains data that details velocity (in 10-yard intervals from 0 to 70 yards); average pellet energy; and time of flight in seconds. This book includes complete ballistic tables for every hull length and every shot-size load made from the following manufacturers: Aguila Ammunition, Armscor, ARMUSA, Baschieri &amp; Pellagri, Bismuth Cartridge Company, Brenneke, Clever s.r.l., Dionisi, Eley Hawk, Estate Cartridge Company, Federal, Fiocchi, Gamebore, Hevi-Shot (now loaded exclusively by Remington), Kent, Lightfield, PMC, Polywad, Remington, RIO, RST, Sellier &amp; Bellot, and Winchester. In addition, this informative reference contains authoritative articles on the history and development of shotshells and the components and technical data that govern the production of shotshells. Never before has so much information on shotshells and ballistics been placed in a single book. Accentuated with photos from the field and the range, this is a reference book unlike any other.</p><h2 id='quickload-reloading-software-download'>Quickload Reloading Software Download</h2><strong>Related Posts</strong><h2 id='quickload-reloading-software-download'>Quickload Reloading Software Download</h2><br><ul><li>Ballistics Coefficient <p>Ballistics Coefficient is the ratio of a bullets Sectional Density to its coefficient of form.
